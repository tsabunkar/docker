# Docker Run

- Run Tag
  - \$ docker run redis:4.0 (4.0 is the tag--> version of this contanierized application)
- Run - STDIN
  - (Run docker command its all - Std output)
  - (bydefault docker don't have standard input, as there is no terminal, so runs in non-interactive mode)
  - \$ docker run -i <image> ( -i ==> parameter is for interactive mode, but prompt is missing)
  - \$ docker run -it <image> ( -i ==> interactive mode, -t ==> Terminal to provide input)
- Run: PORT Mapping
  - docker application ruuning a web server uses port and ip address
  - Docker image ip address can accessed by --> 2 options
    - Internal IP of docker Container (users outside this docker container cannot access this ip addr)
    - Ip of Docker Host (but Need to map a unique PORT with docker container PORT, ex- [.assets/port-mapping.png], [.assets/port-mapping-2.png])
    - NOTE : Cannot Map same PORT in docker Host more than onces
- Run: Volume Mapping (Persisting data in docker container)
  - If we have run mysql applcation(container) and have dump data in it (tables, schema, views, etc) but as soon as we stop this container and remove the container (stop, rm cmd) --> All data will be lost
  - If we want to persist this application(container) specific data then --> Map with outside directory in docker Host
  - \$ docker run -v <docker_host_dir>:<app_container_dir> mysql
  - \$ docker run -v /opt/datadir:/var/lib/mysql mysql
  - [.assets/volume-mapping.png]
- Inspect Container
  - (provides additional details of container - name, IpAddr, ID in JSON format)
- Container Logs
  - (Suppose we run a container in deattached mode, To obtain this container log use ==> logs command)
  - \$ docker container logs <container_id/container_name>
