# You new development environment ?

- In the past, if you were to start writing a Python app, your first order of business was to install a Python runtime onto your machine. But, that creates a situation where the environment on your machine needs to be perfect for your app to run as expected, and also needs to match your production environment.

- Now With Docker, you can just grab a portable Python runtime as an image, no installation necessary. Then, your build can include the base Python image right alongside your app code, ensuring that your app, its dependencies, and the runtime, all travel together.

- These portable images are defined by something called a Dockerfile.
