# Docker :

- Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers.

# Images and Container

- A container is launched by running an image.
- An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application--the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.
- A container is a runtime instance of an image---what the image becomes in memory when executed

# Containerization

- Containerization: Linux containers to deploy applications
- Containerization provides following feature :
  - Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
  - Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
  - Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
  - Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
  - Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
  - Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.

# Containers and virtual machines

- A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.
- a virtual machine (VM) runs a full-blown “guest” operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor
- In general, VMs provide an environment with more resources than most applications need.
